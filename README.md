# My personal site
> *updated: 6/30/2023*

Welcome! I am currently in the process of building a personal website from scratch. You can explore it [here] (omalcolmson.github.io/personal-site/) or by clicking the link on the right-hand side of your screen. 
My goals for this project are to 
1. Learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
2. Provide an in-depth review of projects I have worked on and other job experiences I have had as a means of showcasing my skills.

Thank's for stopping by!
